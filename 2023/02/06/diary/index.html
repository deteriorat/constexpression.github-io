    <section class="markdown-content"><h1 id="a-study-diary-in-English"><a href="#a-study-diary-in-English" class="headerlink" title="a study diary in English"></a>a study diary in English</h1><h4 id="brief"><a href="#brief" class="headerlink" title="brief"></a>brief</h4><p>On purpose of recording my daily issues,thus pushing me to learn something rather than wasting time,I’m trying to write this article. let’s  see how long I can persist.</p>
<p>maybe I’ll not update to github that often. But I do will record it locally.</p>
<h4 id="2023-2-2"><a href="#2023-2-2" class="headerlink" title="2023.2.2"></a>2023.2.2</h4><p>today morning I recited some English words. My reciting schedule now is 45 new and 135 reviewing. After that I learned to setup my own blog from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Yb411a7ty/?spm_id_from=333.1007.top_right_bar_window_history.content.click&vd_source=d9cd5d22d04e2b4824ac58edfd5d52ef">手把手教你从0开始搭建自己的个人博客 |无坑版视频教程| hexo_哔哩哔哩_bilibili</a> .It’s quite fabulous. May be I should establish (or copy) some personal project.</p>
<p>in the afternoon I’m gonna to finish sever leetcodes and start to learn the subjects to be tested in  the start of next semester.</p>
<p>well. didn’t do that much. I did only one leetcode which is about joseph ring. It’s a little hard to understand. I spent lots of time on considering how the dynamic programing works. The crucial part is comprehensive the meaning of the compressed dp variable, hence we could make out the recurrence formula clear.</p>
<p>In the night I had dinner with some of my father’s friends. And finished all the English words. What’s more, I taught my little brother to write characters. before sleeping I played apex. My shooting accuracy is not that good now.</p>
<p>tomorrow I will reduce my time spending on QQ. Those large chunk of time should be applied to more meaningful tasks.</p>
<h4 id="2023-2-3"><a href="#2023-2-3" class="headerlink" title="2023.2.3"></a>2023.2.3</h4><p>Today morning I firstly recited half the load of daily words. Then I spent nearly an hour reading the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir/pguo-PhD-grind.pdf">http://www.pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir/pguo-PhD-grind.pdf</a> for around one and half an hour. Then I started one leetcode about simulation. Not a difficult one,but due to my negligence,I mistake two dimension of a matrix…idiot.</p>
<p>Emm. Started from 3 pm. Did two problems. One for the in&amp;output sequence of stack. One for string judgement which  is associated with “finite state machine”. Interesting. Not familiar with that. </p>
<p>woah,a little tired. Only one leetcode tonight. I need to raise my efficiency. Good night.</p>
<h4 id="2023-2-4"><a href="#2023-2-4" class="headerlink" title="2023.2.4"></a>2023.2.4</h4><p>It’s Saturday! I finished today’s English words. Played Genshin Impact for  1.5 h or more. Kind of bored now. Will need to do more things in the rest of the day.</p>
<p>In the rest of the day, I played Arknights for the whole afternoon. In the night I played guitar till about 10:00 pm. Before sleeping I might learn the specialized courses.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Lantern Festival. It implicates the end of winter vacation.</p>
<h4 id="2023-2-6"><a href="#2023-2-6" class="headerlink" title="2023.2.6"></a>2023.2.6</h4><p>oops. Played for two days. I only finished the daily English reciting. Today morning I played games, and watch three-body the television drama. It’s a good piece, to tell the truth. After finishing it, I felt some soft part deeply in my heart were touched. Because the staying up late these days, I’ve got no efficiency during the day. Must rectify that.</p>
<p>I need to exploit those partial time fragments. HUSTLE!</p>
<h4 id="2023-2-7"><a href="#2023-2-7" class="headerlink" title="2023.2.7"></a>2023.2.7</h4><p>today morning, I finished 45 words in 37 min. Not a good score. I could attribute that to chatting in QQ groups. It’s so meaningless. After that I accomplished two leetcodes For one and half an hour mingled with some rest time. I the Afternoon I’ll review my curricula. In conclusion, rest well is the basis of high efficiency.</p>
<p>By the way, ずっと真夜中でいいのに is so melodious. I like j-pop!</p>
<h4 id="2023-2-8"><a href="#2023-2-8" class="headerlink" title="2023.2.8"></a>2023.2.8</h4><p>till 15:44, I finished English words, and did one reading practice before noon break. In the morning, I learned the knowledges of threads in operating system. Listening to the teacher did helped a lot. What’s more, played Genshin for a while as watching the video .pressure is high, still need to persist. I gonna to do some leetcodes, practice the guitar and finish the fourth chapter of os.</p>
<p>then I could play.</p>
<p>well, went drinking with my dad this evening. played ggd and apex for about 3 hours. Then finished the leetcode opened in the afternoon. Leetcodes could be treated as some entertainment.</p>
<p>Bullshit, didn’t play guitar again.</p>
<h4 id="2023-2-9"><a href="#2023-2-9" class="headerlink" title="2023.2.9"></a>2023.2.9</h4><p>Stayed up late yesterday. Maybe the reason is I’ve got too much tasks on myself. I can’t feel happy during my daily life. So in the night I scrolling the mobile phone on and on. Such an idiot sort of thing. So, try to be happier.</p>
<p>Today morning I did half the English words. I raised the daily number to 50&#x2F;150. As a matter of fact, that’s not a big deal,really.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I finished a leetcode and the rest English. A little tired now, so played games in English while listening to a experience sharing of a HKU applier. Need to do more in the night. Wish I could get abored one day.</p>
<h4 id="2023-2-11"><a href="#2023-2-11" class="headerlink" title="2023.2.11"></a>2023.2.11</h4><p>well. returned to HUST today. Finished words and played MHW.Went running in the night, and played guitar with friends.</p>
<p>good night.</p>
<h4 id="2023-2-12"><a href="#2023-2-12" class="headerlink" title="2023.2.12"></a>2023.2.12</h4><p>Today I woke up at 8:20 am. Slept well last night. Roommates are anxious about their future. But I don’t think hustling equals high efficiency. I need to schedule conscientiously. And devote my passion to my target.</p>
<p>First canteen meal this year is hot dry noodles. Settled in first floor of the school library at around 9:00 am. I finished 50 words and started to learn os. I can finish the fourth chapter today. Felling a little tired now,I’m going to do some toefl readings before lunch. By the way, I shared a desk with some girls. Such a pleasant thing!</p>
<p>I like university.</p>
<p>In the afternoon woke up at 14:00. I finished English and the fourth chapter after submitting some materials. Then I lent some books form the library. Feeling tired now. I want to do one more leetcode.</p>
<p>played for 3 hours in the night. Actually meaningless .learn and sleep.</p>
<h4 id="2023-2-13"><a href="#2023-2-13" class="headerlink" title="2023.2.13"></a>2023.2.13</h4><p>Today woke up at 7:30. Slept for 6.5 h. Feeling good. Arrived at library at about 9. That’s a little late. Same seat as yesterday, I might try the calligraphy today.</p>
<p>now it’s 9:39. finished 50 words, do one leetcode. </p>
<p>10:30. Start to review.</p>
<p>arrived at 14:20. played the mobile phone for too long at noon. Wasting time.</p>
<p>at 16:10, finished English words,totally about fifty minutes. Reviewed OS for pretty a long time. The atmosphere in library is really good, despite there might comes some annoying couples sitting by your sides. </p>
<p>finished chap.6 at 17:18. I want to do some sports in the evening.</p>
<p>did sports and played for 4 h. Good night.</p>
<h4 id="2023-2-14"><a href="#2023-2-14" class="headerlink" title="2023.2.14"></a>2023.2.14</h4><p>Today arrived a little late, and the electricity plug were already occupied by the girl sitting in front of me. Same girl as yesterday. Does she have a boyfriend? Why come here in Valentine’s Day? </p>
<p>Well, 50 words to begin ,and search for the information of research for this summer vacation.  Then wrote an essay about information cocoons.</p>
<p>Should learn more in the afternoon.</p>
<p>arrived at 14:30. Switched the battery of my electricity bike for 300 yuan. It’s hard to earn money. Now start with an leetcode.  </p>
<p>finished at 15:13.</p>
<p>went out at 4:30. Finished chap.7. ate and  played with friends.Tired . Good night.</p>
<h4 id="2023-2-15"><a href="#2023-2-15" class="headerlink" title="2023.2.15"></a>2023.2.15</h4><p>Today woke up before 8. Although the alarm was set in half past 7 ,I still postponed for near half an hour.</p>
<p>arrived at about half past 8. And finished 25 words for 20 minutes. I might reduce the amount of daily words and increase TPO exercises.</p>
<p>Now it’s 9:26. Do a leetcode first. Be meticulous.</p>
<p>10:11.finished one. I want to finish another one.</p>
<p>arrived at 14:20. Hard to begin. Let’s start with a leetcode. I’ll learn DBMS in the afternoon , otherwise I’m gonna to die. </p>
<p>finished at 15:13。</p>
<p>Today, not good. Nearly wasted a whole night. Sore in chest. rest early.</p>
<h4 id="2023-2-16"><a href="#2023-2-16" class="headerlink" title="2023.2.16"></a>2023.2.16</h4><p>Today I arrived before 8:30. A girl sat in front of the seat I used to occupy.   And a black leather backpack. I sat there and she went away. A little strange. Today no girls are to be my desk mate. So disappointing.</p>
<p>Open a leetcode. Today I’m going to select class. </p>
<p>complemented in 2.17. Yesterday afternoon I might have learned some knowledges about database. But at night I were too tired. As adjusting my mind state, I read one MCM essay. After that I went for massage with my classmate. Feeling good. </p>
<h4 id="2023-2-17"><a href="#2023-2-17" class="headerlink" title="2023.2.17"></a>2023.2.17</h4><p>Today is for MCM. It reminds me of the painful experience one year ago….. Well , too much pressure.</p>
<p>But I need to persist. My not-that-bad score now also attributes to the fighting myself a year ago. So, keep on keeping on!</p>
<p>Might choose  A problem. </p>
<h4 id="2023-2-22"><a href="#2023-2-22" class="headerlink" title="2023.2.22"></a>2023.2.22</h4><p>OOPS. Occupied by all sorts of things, I gapped several days. Yesterday returned to normal lives, but not that efficiency. I nearly wasted one day. Finished the chores in school-working apartment, I must focus on DBMS today. Good luck to me. My efforts  will return one day. Keep on keeping on!</p>
<p>Actually there exists numerous things to do better than playing games or scrolling the mobile phone lying on bed. Such as read some blogs about someone else’s life. Even play some meaningful digital games is better than wasting time worrying about future.</p>
<p>I bought Steins Gate last week. Hopefully it can benefit me.</p>
<p>Ehh, played guitar till 8:30. Start now, or I’ll die.</p>
<h4 id="2023-2-24"><a href="#2023-2-24" class="headerlink" title="2023.2.24"></a>2023.2.24</h4><p>Yesterday not in a good mood. I found that playing games is not that good in adjusting mood. Listening to music or chatting with someone else is better.</p>
<p>Today waked up feeling good. Review for OS now.</p>
<p>Not good in the morning. So stay sharp in the afternoon.  </p>
<p>Feeling too tired in the night. That I don’t want to move. Soooo fking crazy. </p>
<p>hold on for the last night.</p>
<h4 id="2023-2-27"><a href="#2023-2-27" class="headerlink" title="2023.2.27"></a>2023.2.27</h4><p>上午上课，背单词。下午睡觉打游戏。晚上上课，打牌</p>
<h4 id="2023-2-28"><a href="#2023-2-28" class="headerlink" title="2023.2.28"></a>2023.2.28</h4><p>OS course design is way too hard…</p>
<p>went to public class tonight. Teacher is beautiful. Did a leetcode hard problem. Nice practice. Going to do one TPO now and rest</p>
<h4 id="2023-3-1"><a href="#2023-3-1" class="headerlink" title="2023.3.1"></a>2023.3.1</h4><p>Hello March! Once I speed up, the accuracy of reading test decreases. Need more practice. What’s more, I confirmed that I’ve got only one shoot on entering Univ Tokyo. So, I need to be well prepared.</p>
<p>wake up a little late because of stay up too late for exchanging information yesterday night. Need high efficiency today.</p>
<p>Sometimes I forget why I’m so busy. Plan to go to the gym tonight. </p>
<h4 id="2023-3-4"><a href="#2023-3-4" class="headerlink" title="2023.3.4"></a>2023.3.4</h4><p>Death Stranding is a good game. I seem to know how to live a life.</p>
<h4 id="2023-3-9"><a href="#2023-3-9" class="headerlink" title="2023.3.9"></a>2023.3.9</h4><p>Didn’t update that recently. I finished the OS course design. It’s really a hard course, thanks to my roommates who taught me a lot. Partly accomplished it by myself, I still obtained a lot. I had a better comprehension of the OS. How it works, how process and memory are organized, etc. Well, it also taught me that no pain, no gain. Such a simple theory, but so difficult to practically do it.</p>
<p>To day not in high efficiency. Didn’t focus in the morning. Woke up in 2:15. And got the notation of NUS summer school, acquiring information of it. And I finished an interview. So it’s now… I might practice guitar for a while, and listen to that zoom meeting in the night.</p>
<h4 id="2023-3-10"><a href="#2023-3-10" class="headerlink" title="2023.3.10"></a>2023.3.10</h4><p>happy. No learning.</p>
<h4 id="2023-3-31"><a href="#2023-3-31" class="headerlink" title="2023.3.31"></a>2023.3.31</h4><p>End of March. I’m changing my ideas. So do your best. No more postponing.</p>
